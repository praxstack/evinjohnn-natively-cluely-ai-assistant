/**
 * SIMPLE Auto Answer engine (user decision 2026-08-25) — "legacy trigger,
 * judge brain".
 *
 * Six live rounds showed the V3 candidate machinery (quiet windows, revision
 * re-judging, act heuristics, channel state machine) eating real questions
 * before the judge — which was never wrong — could rule. This engine is the
 * requested middle ground:
 *
 *   interviewer speech STOPS (stability window, endpoint-shortened)
 *     → cheap local prefilter (dup / backchannel / too short — zero cost)
 *       → ONE judge call ("autoanswer yes/no" + the extracted question)
 *         → dispatch | offer | silent.
 *
 * Cost/latency discipline:
 *  - one call per STOPPAGE, never per final (V3 judged one utterance 6×);
 *  - interims and finals both restart the stability window, so the call fires
 *    only when the interviewer has actually stopped — and the window overlaps
 *    the LLM latency the user must wait through anyway;
 *  - a call is superseded (never applied) when new interviewer speech arrives
 *    while it is in flight — the next stoppage re-judges with more context;
 *  - the judge prompt's static prefix enables implicit provider caching.
 *
 * The user channel is INERT (user decision 2026-09-03). The user answers the
 * moment a question lands — nobody sits in silence waiting for the overlay —
 * so their own speech never cancels a streaming answer, never clears a
 * candidate and never drops a parked or deferred verdict. The mic is still
 * transcribed (the judge sees both sides), it just has no vote here. This
 * retired the 2026-08-24 "lenient mic" policy and its echo latch with it.
 * Judge unavailable → almost-legacy fallback: dispatch only when the stopped
 * speech ends with '?'.
