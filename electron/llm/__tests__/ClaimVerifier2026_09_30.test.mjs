// The claim verifier (2026-09-30) — see electron/llm/claimVerifier.ts.
//
// Every earlier safeguard against invented claims was prompt text, and the
// external judge still capped 42-55% of Sales, Call Center and Looking-for-work
// answers for statements nothing supported. A short edit pass that sees the
// material the answer was built from moved them (offline: Sales 6.93 -> 8.29,
// Looking-for-work 6.73 -> 7.5-7.8). These tests pin which turns get the pass,
// what an edit must satisfy before it replaces the answer, and where the pass
// sits in the what-to-answer pipeline.
