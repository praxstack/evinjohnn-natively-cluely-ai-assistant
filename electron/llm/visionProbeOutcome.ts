// screenshots, so it needs positive evidence: a recognised image refusal, or a
// real reply that does not contain the number. An empty daily pool, a rate
// limit, a timeout, a content filter and an auth failure are all "unknown".

// Deliberately broad: wrongly calling a reply "unknown" costs a retry later;
// wrongly calling it "no" blocks a capable model for a month. The last
// alternative is a bare HTTP status ("429", "503") sent as the whole reply.
