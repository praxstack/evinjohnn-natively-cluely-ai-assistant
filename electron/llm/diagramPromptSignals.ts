// electron/llm/diagramPromptSignals.ts
//
// THE single place a prompt surface asks "is this a diagram turn, and what does
// the prompt need for it?". The sibling of codingPromptSignals.ts, for the same
// reason that module exists: every surface (What to Answer, typed chat on V3
// and legacy, the engine's manual answer, LLMHelper's self-composed fallbacks,
// follow-ups, brainstorm, Direct Assist, the phone) used to be free to decide
// this on its own, and independent decisions drift.
//
// Detection of the question's ROUTE stays with AnswerPlanner; the semantic
// diagram decision lives in src/lib/diagram/diagramRequest.mjs (pure, shared
// with the renderer). This module only gathers what that resolver needs from
// the main process — the feature switch, the user's standing instructions, the
// design on the table — and returns:
//
//   signals    BOUNDED enums + example ids, safe for the registered/cached
//              system prompt (promptSystemV2 keys a Map by prompt text);
//   turnBlock  the DYNAMIC part (the current design's Mermaid source), for the
//              turn's user content — never the system prompt.
//
// A diagram turn is never a coding turn: nothing here touches codingTask, the
// code-verification spec, or isCodingAnswerType.

// TYPE-ONLY imports of the shared modules, on purpose. This file is statically
// imported by AnswerLLM / WhatToAnswerLLM / BrainstormLLM, and four test suites
// compile that import graph file by file with tsc (tsconfig.emit.json). In such
// a tree a `.mjs` module that has a `.d.mts` sibling is resolved as types and
// never emitted, so a static import here would make every one of those suites
// fail to load. The modules are required at the point of use instead (shared());
// esbuild bundles those requires like any other, so the shipped app is unaffected.
