// 42-55% of Sales, Call Center and Looking-for-work answers for claims nothing
// supported — "$412 per seat" with no price sheet, "HVAC is a big part of who we
// work with", "I'm open to relocating", "that works as a starting point for me",
// an invented weakness. Four prompt formulations moved these by 0-0.5 points.
//
// A second, short pass that sees exactly what the answer was built from (the
// composed V3 user message: question, conversation, evidence) and removes what
// that material does not state did move them. Offline on the dev set, judged
// externally: Sales 6.93 -> 8.29 (hard fails 18 -> 5), Looking-for-work
// 6.73 -> 7.5-7.8 (22 -> 10-13), one deepseek-flash call, p50 ~0.8 s.
//
// It runs where the doc-grounded repair already runs — after the stream, before
// the final answer is emitted — so time to first word is unchanged; the final
// text replaces the streamed one when it differs (the existing repair
// contract). Every edit must pass deterministic rails (acceptVerifiedAnswer);
// anything doubtful keeps the original. Pure module: the engine owns the call.

 * claim. Asked "Who's grabbing this one?", "I can take this one" became "I'll
 * come back on who's picking it up"; "Let's do the pads today and hold off on
 * the rotors" became a question to the mechanic. Of 149 in-app edits, 36 ended
 * in a question the draft did not ask and 26 lost a decision or ownership.
 * The list now takes only three kinds — a past fact, a fact about the speaker,
 * a consequential promise — and names what is NOT a claim: a decision made
 * now, taking a task, a recommendation, an ordinary small commitment. A second
 * line names a conflict inside the material, which the reply must surface
 * instead of asserting one side. Replayed on the same 256 drafts: replies
 * turned into a question 37 -> 4, decisions lost 28 -> 10, edits to
 * document-grounded replies 33 -> 13 of 72.
 *
 * NOT enforced in code, on purpose: about a fifth of the listed phrases
 * survive in the model's own reply, and most of those are listing mistakes it
 * then corrects (a résumé's "about 2.3 million a day" listed, then kept).
 * Deleting every listed sentence would remove grounded facts.

Work in two steps and output both.
Step 1, one line starting "UNSUPPORTED:" — only the phrases of the draft that state AS FACT something the material does not state, each followed by its kind in square brackets, separated by " | ":
[past] something that already happened or is already true and that only a record can establish: what they did, led, built, measured or agreed, a number, a price, a policy, a procedure, a capability, a customer, a result;
[self] a fact about who they already are: an existing preference, habit, motive, feeling, strength or weakness, or when they are available;
[promise] a promise with consequences: money, a refund or credit, a price or discount, a contract term, a delivery date or deadline, a guarantee, what the product or the company will do.
Never list these, they are not claims that need a record: a decision or choice they make now ("let's do the pads today", "I can take this", "I'd go with REST here"); taking a task or offering to; a recommendation or professional judgment ("I'd shift the plan rather than re-plan it"); an ordinary small commitment ("I'll send that today", "I'll check and come back to you", "I'll stay on this with you"); general knowledge; what the other person said; what the material states.
Write "UNSUPPORTED: none" when there is nothing to list.
Then one line starting "CONFLICT:" — if the material itself gives two different values or rules for the very thing that was asked, both in a few words; otherwise "CONFLICT: none".
Step 2, after a line containing only "---" — the revised reply, built by these rules in order:
1. Every phrase you listed is gone: none of them appears, in any wording.
2. Everything you did not list stays word for word, decisions, ownership, recommendations and small commitments included.
3. If CONFLICT is not "none", the reply asserts neither value. Where the draft asserted one, one sentence says it is given two ways, names both values, and says it needs confirming before anyone relies on it. If the draft already says so, leave it.
4. If removing the listed phrases leaves what was asked without an answer, do not hand the question back to the other person. For a preference, a willingness or their availability: one short sentence, in their own voice, that they will confirm it and come back on it, with a day if the draft implied one. For a reason, a motive or an event in their own past: the plain facts about it that are stated (the dates, the role, the project; for a question about a job, what that job is), said as their own facts, and nothing invented after it.
The reply is spoken by them: it never says "the material", "the record" or where a fact comes from.
If nothing was listed and there is no conflict, the revised reply is the draft unchanged.`;
