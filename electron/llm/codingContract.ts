//
// History: the section spec was duplicated across prompts.ts (colon labels),
// tinyPrompts.ts (comma list), AnswerPlanner.ts (## headings), the assist
// prompt (### Dry Run), and AnswerValidator.ts (## headings). The model got
// contradictory instructions and the validator's `## ` check could reject the
// very format another prompt asked for. This module ends that.
//
// Dependency-free on purpose (no imports) so it can be pulled into prompts.ts,
// AnswerPlanner.ts, AnswerValidator.ts, and tests without any cycle risk.

- Short, interview-speakable explanation of the idea. Optimized approach clearly; brute force only if useful.

## Technique
- Name the core DSA concept/data structure/algorithm (e.g. two pointers, sliding window, hash map, stack, queue, binary search, DP, BFS/DFS, heap, trie, union-find, recursion, backtracking).

## Code
- Clean, correct, interview-ready code in ONE fenced block, tagged with the language you ACTUALLY wrote (\`\`\`python, \`\`\`java, \`\`\`cpp, \`\`\`javascript, \`\`\`typescript, \`\`\`go, \`\`\`rust, \`\`\`sql). A Java answer is tagged \`\`\`java, never \`\`\`python. Meaningful names, minimal comments. Do NOT start the answer with code — the \`## Approach\` heading comes first.

## Dry Run
- Walk through ONE sample input step by step and show how the code reaches the output.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(...), because ...
- Space Complexity: O(...), because ...

## Interviewer Follow-up Points
- Syntax/built-ins, edge cases, assumptions, duplicates, boundaries, tradeoffs, or optimizations the interviewer might probe.

</verification_spec>

Rules for the spec:
- "entry" MUST be the exact name of the function/method a caller would invoke in your Code (for a "class Solution" method, use the method name).
- "input" is the ARGUMENT LIST passed to that function, in order (wrap a single argument in a one-element array).
- Include EVERY example from the problem statement, PLUS 1-3 edge cases (empty input, duplicates, boundaries) you are confident about.
- Use only concrete JSON values (numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, null). No code, no expressions, no comments.
- LINKED LISTS / BINARY TREES: if any argument or the return value is a linked list (ListNode) or binary tree (TreeNode), add "argTypes" and/or "retType" so the runner can build/compare them. Use "list" for a linked list, "tree" for a binary tree, "value" (or omit) otherwise. Encode a linked list as a plain array [1,2,3]; encode a binary tree in LeetCode LEVEL-ORDER with null for missing nodes, e.g. [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]. Example: \`{"entry":"reverseList","language":"python","argTypes":["list"],"retType":"list","cases":[{"input":[[1,2,3]],"expected":[3,2,1]}]}\`.
- SQL: if your Code is a SQL query, set "language":"sql" and OMIT "entry"/"cases". Instead provide "schema" (array of CREATE TABLE statements), "seeds" (array of INSERT statements), and "expected" (the result-set rows as {column: value} objects using your SELECT's output column names/aliases). Add "ordered":true ONLY if the problem requires a specific row order; otherwise omit it (rows compare order-insensitively). Write standard SQL that runs on SQLite. Only a single read-only SELECT is verified. Example: \`{"language":"sql","schema":["CREATE TABLE T(id INT, v INT)"],"seeds":["INSERT INTO T VALUES (1,10),(2,20)"],"expected":[{"id":2,"v":20}]}\`. If you cannot give reliable schema/seed/expected, emit \`{"language":"sql","schema":[],"seeds":[],"expected":[]}\` to skip verification rather than guess.
- If you genuinely cannot produce reliable expected outputs, output \`<verification_spec>{"entry":"<name>","language":"<lang>","cases":[]}</verification_spec>\` rather than guessing wrong values.`;
