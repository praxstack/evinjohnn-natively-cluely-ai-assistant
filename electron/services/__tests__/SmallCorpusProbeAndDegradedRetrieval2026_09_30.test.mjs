// Two retriever-side reasons an attached file never reached the prompt (2026-09-30).
//
// 1. SMALL-CORPUS ARBITRATION. buildLexicalStats() returns null below
//    IDF_MIN_POOL (12) chunks and probeAnchors returned false whenever it did —
//    so for an ordinary upload of a few pages (1–8 semantic chunks) corpus
//    arbitration could never rescue a general-looking question. Small pools are
//    now judged by the SHARE of the question's content words one chunk holds.
//    Fixtures are written as real slides / a real thesis section, not echoes of
//    the questions, so a positive cannot pass vacuously.
//
// 2. THE hybrid_threw BRANCH. A query embed that hard-fails mid-turn lands in a
//    catch that ran lexical retrieval with NO floor, and the retriever's result
//    said nothing about it (usedFallback reads false there). It now gets the
//    same floors as the embedder-unavailable branch, and reports degradedReason.

Slide 1. Overview: glycolysis (cytoplasm), pyruvate oxidation, citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation.
Slide 2. Glycolysis yields a net 2 ATP and 2 NADH per glucose and needs no oxygen.
Slide 3. The electron transport chain sits in the inner mitochondrial membrane. NADH and FADH2 hand their electrons to complexes I-IV, which pump protons into the intermembrane space.
Slide 4. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor: at complex IV each O2 takes four electrons and four protons to form two water molecules. Without oxygen the chain backs up and the cell falls back to fermentation.
Slide 5. ATP synthase uses the proton gradient (chemiosmosis) to make most of the cell's ATP.`;

  `4.1 Setup. We fine-tune a 300M-parameter speech encoder on 42 hours of transcribed Swahili broadcast speech. Sparse adapters of rank 8 are inserted after every feed-forward block; only 1.9% of the parameters are trained. Both models train for exactly 30,000 steps with the same schedule.`,
  `4.2 Main result. Across five runs with different random seeds, sparse adapters reach 18.4% word error rate against 21.1% for full fine-tuning. The seed-to-seed standard deviation is 0.3; a paired bootstrap test gives p < 0.01, so the gains are well outside run-to-run noise.`,
  `4.4 Limitations. All experiments use a single language and a single domain (broadcast news). A replication on Yoruba and Amharic is left for future work.`,
