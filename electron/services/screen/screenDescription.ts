/**
 * The screenshot a user attached, rendered as text so it survives its own turn.
 *
 * The image itself is gone from the payload long before a follow-up arrives —
 * ScreenshotHelper unlinks past a 5-deep queue, and no path re-sends bytes for
 * an old turn — so this string is ALL a later "what was in that screenshot?"
 * has to read. That is why it is assembled here, once, rather than inline at
 * each call site: the version at ipcHandlers.ts:1488 silently omitted
 * `errors`, so the field the extraction schema names for error lines never
 * reached the conversation ring, and the single most common follow-up
 * ("what was the error code?") lost the one field written to answer it.
 *
 * FIELD ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. Whatever truncates this — the ring's per-turn
 * cap, the mode's conversation budget — truncates the TAIL, so the sections
 * are ordered by how often a follow-up asks about them. Errors and identifiers
 * are the most-asked and the least reconstructible; a table usually is not.
 *
 * Sections are labelled because the result reaches the model days-deep in a
 * history block with no other framing, and an unlabelled wall of screen text
 * reads as prose the model may treat as its own prior claim.

/**
 * Recorded when a screenshot WAS attached but could not be transcribed — the

 * denied.
 *
 * Observed live: when understand() fails, the turn still answers correctly,
 * because the raw image bytes reach the answering model on a separate path. So
 * nothing looks wrong at the time. Two turns later the follow-up said "I don't
 * have a record of a screenshot ... in our conversation history" — flatly
 * DENYING the screenshot existed, which is worse than admitting it cannot be
 * read: the user knows they sent one, so the answer reads as the assistant
 * losing their data rather than as a transcription gap.
