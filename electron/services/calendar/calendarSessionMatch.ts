/**
 * Which calendar event a Natively session belongs to, decided from time alone.
 *
 * Every start, not just one from the calendar notification, asks this which
 * event is on now. The answer names the meeting (its title), who was in it (its
 * attendees: the follow-up's recipients and, for a 1:1, the other speaker's
 * name) and what it was for. A wrong answer poisons all of that, so it links
 * only on a clear winner and says "ambiguous" otherwise; the meeting notes then
 * offer the candidates rather than guessing.
 *
 * How the others do it (researched 2026-09-27): Krisp matches the recording's
 * time to the event's; Granola links the note you open at or after an event's
 * start and pre-arms one opened early; bots (Otter, Fireflies, Fathom) are the
 * event, so need no matching. Natively has no meeting-app signal at start, so
 * time and the event's own shape (other people on it) are the evidence.
 *
 * Pure, with no Electron and no I/O, so the tests run it directly.
