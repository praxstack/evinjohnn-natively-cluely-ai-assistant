// THE lexical tokenizer for hybrid retrieval. One implementation, imported by
// both ModeContextRetriever and ModeHybridRetriever.
//
// It previously existed as two copies carrying the warning "Keep this in
// lock-step with ModeContextRetriever.wordsOf — divergence breaks hybrid score
// fusion." They had already drifted in comments; a functional drift would have
// silently mis-fused FTS and vector scores, which is exactly the class of bug a
// comment cannot prevent. Sharing the code removes the hazard.
//
// NUMERAL EQUIVALENCE — measured defect
// A user asking "How fast did Natively reach ten thousand users?" retrieved
// NOTHING from a résumé that says "scaled Natively to 10k users in the first 90
// days". Measured on corpus question A-03:
//
//   query "…reach ten thousand users?"  ->  résumé fts 0.000  ·  NOT retrieved
//   query "…reach 10k users?"           ->  résumé fts 0.152  ·  retrieved
//
// The vector score alone (0.196) could not clear MIN_COMBINED_SCORE, so the
// lexical arm contributing zero decided the turn. Spelled-out numbers, compact
// magnitudes and comma-grouped digits are the same quantity and must produce the
// same token.

// tie-break leaves it (measured 2026-09-19: needle either in the top 6 or
// ranked 50th–350th, nothing in between — a wider rerank pool cannot reach
// rank 300).
//
// The weighted form is the SAME formula with each term worth its inverse
// document frequency over the pool being ranked:
//
//     Σ w(t∈Q∩C) / sqrt( Σ w(t∈Q) · Σ w(t∈C) )
//
// It stays in [0, 1], is invariant to the scale of w, and reduces exactly to
// the legacy score when every weight is equal — so the thresholds calibrated
// against the legacy scale (MIN_LEXICAL_SCORE, the combined floor) keep their
// meaning. Below IDF_MIN_POOL chunks document frequencies are noise, and the

// BOTH rare terms had the top lexical score (0.203 vs 0.155) and still ranked
// 57th, because cosine similarity between a question and 338 same-shaped
// sections is noise (0.20–0.33) carrying 0.6 of the weight.

// "10" (8 chunks) and "Eyrie" (12) both missed it, though together they name
// exactly one section. Sections are identified by a CONJUNCTION of moderately
// rare terms, so there is no per-term rarity cutoff; a term anchors when most
// of the pool lacks it (idf ≥ ln 2), and the idf weighting decides how much
