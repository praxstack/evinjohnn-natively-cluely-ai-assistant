// src/components/onboarding/useGenieCard.ts
//
// The macOS genie, as a hook: an onboarding card pours out of a slot at the
// bottom centre of the window on open and pours back into it on close, the way
// a minimised window pours into its Dock icon.
//
// The GEOMETRY lives in genieMotion.mjs. This hook measures the card, cuts it
// into bands, and runs the clock — the part BrowserExtensionToaster used to own
// inline. It was lifted out verbatim when the permissions card needed the same
// entrance, because two copies of a 48-band animation are two places for the
// timings to drift apart (CLAUDE.md: do not duplicate a feature when only a
// small integration differs).
//
// The host renders four nodes and hands back their refs:
//
//   wrap   — never transformed, so it reports where the card sits at rest even
//            while the card is mid-genie. Measured, not animated.
//   card   — the real card.
//   shadow — a stand-in that carries the card's drop shadow mid-genie.
//   bands  — an empty layer the band copies are built into.
//
// Close is sequenced: the host usually unmounts the moment it reports a
// dismiss, which would cut the animation off, so the card closes itself FIRST
// and reports through `closeThen` once the genie has played.

  about 60 px it stops reading as motion and starts to strobe. A strong
  ease-out here made the top edge jump 166 px in a frame; a linear clock, 45.
  This curve moves it at most ~55 px opening and ~60 closing, because the
  runs are a little longer than before (0.65 / 0.6 s, inside macOS's range:
  the GNOME port uses 560 / 480 ms, Harshil Shah's 700). The close is the
