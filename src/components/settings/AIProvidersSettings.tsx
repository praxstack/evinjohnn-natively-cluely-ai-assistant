/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   AI Providers design system — a locally-scoped token block, PI-style.

   WHAT IS AND IS NOT PANEL-LOCAL (revised — the CONTAINER LAYER now aliases
   the app-wide tokens):

     The CARD is `--bg-item-surface` behind a `--border-subtle` edge, in both
     themes. That is the exact pair every card in this panel carried at
     3e8ea9fa, and it is theme-invariant as an EXPRESSION — the split lives in
     the token (#27272A dark / #EAECEF light; transparent dark / 7% black
     light), so it is declared once and cannot drift per theme.

     A previous pass aliased the card to General's dark container instead
     (`bg-transparent`). That is only survivable on General because every
     General card holds a SINGLE ROW: the row's own content is the object, so
     the container may be notional. These cards are multi-row structured
     objects — header + key field + action row + a nested disclosure — and
     without a fill they degraded into hollow outlines with no surface. The
     card here must be a real surface; General's dark transparency is not a
     portable rule.

     The WELL — the layer BELOW a card — is a black wash rather than a flat
     token, because it has to read as recessed against THREE different parents:
     a card, the page canvas, and (for the cURL examples) another well. A flat
     value can only be correct against one of them; an alpha compounds down the
     stack automatically. See the note above ".aip-well".

     Everything BELOW the container — buttons, inputs, the field shell, chips,
     badges, the switch, text roles — stays `--aip-*`. Those need a translucent
     compositing hairline that no Tailwind pair produces: in dark
     `--border-subtle` is literally `transparent` (src/index.css:84) and the
     only visible border token is `--border-muted` (#333, opaque, far heavier
     than a hairline), so a control built on them is either edgeless or heavy.

   `--border-subtle` is NOT changed globally: dozens of other components were
   built against a transparent value.

   The accent is ALIASED, not re-declared per theme: this panel renders inside
   `[data-settings-theme="periwinkle"]` (SettingsOverlay.tsx) where
   `--accent-primary` already resolves to periwinkle-300 dark / periwinkle-600 light.
   `--text-danger` is reused for the same reason (it is already theme-split
   because one red cannot clear 4.5:1 on both fills).

   Tailwind is still used for LAYOUT only inside `.aip-root`. Colour comes from
   `var(--aip-*)`.

   Motion is CSS-only with ONE exception: the provider tablist's selection pill,
   whose translate is driven by a framer-motion spring so it matches the
   meeting-notes Summary/Transcript/Usage switcher (see the tablist below). It is
   still one transform on one element — framer-motion is the driver, not a new
   layer of layout work, and layout/`layoutId` projection is deliberately avoided
   there for a scroll regression documented at the call site. Everything else
   stays on the compositor, which matters because this renderer also hosts the
   always-on-top overlay and a 3s Ollama poll. framer-motion is already loaded in
   this renderer by the sibling settings panels (Plans, Intelligence, Help, Pro,
   Natively API), so the exception adds no bundle cost that was not already
   being paid.
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */
/* Exported so other panels can adopt this design language. Every token below is
   scoped to `.aip-root`, and this sheet is mounted by whichever panel renders it
   — Settings mounts one panel at a time, so a consumer on another tab has to
   bring the sheet with it or every .aip-* class silently resolves to nothing.
   Duplicate <style> elements are harmless: identical rules, same cascade. */
/**
 * The container class for a selector on the right of a hero card (Active Model,
 * Background Model, AI Response Language here; Active Embedding Model, Active
 * Reranker and the embedding width picker in Retrieval).
 *
 * It fits its content: the picker grows with its label. Active Model and
 * Background Model fit theirs, never narrower than "Gemini 3.8 Flash"
 * (ModelSelect minLabel); the others cap theirs at PICKER_LABEL_MAX_CHARS.

/* ── Dismissal. A one-shot card that disappears on click, without the rest of
      the panel snapping up into the hole it left.

      grid-template-rows 1fr -> 0fr is the only way to transition to a content
      height CSS never had to compute — "height: auto" is not an animatable
      value, and a hardcoded max-height would be either a clip or a stall
      depending on how a translation wrapped. The child needs min-height:0 (grid
      items floor at min-content otherwise, and nothing moves) and
      overflow:hidden (so the content is clipped by the shrinking track rather
      than spilling past it).

      The grid ITEM must be a bare div — no padding, no border. min-height:0
      lets its CONTENT reach zero, but its own padding and border box cannot
      shrink, so putting the card (p-5, 1px border) directly in the track floors
      the collapse at 42px. Measured, not assumed: the first version of this
      stopped dead at exactly 20+20+2.

      The card's LEADING gap rides inside the track too, as padding on a child
      of that bare item, rather than as the space-y margin it would otherwise
      inherit — a margin outside the track survives the collapse and lands as a
      20px jump at unmount. The TRAILING gap is left to the next sibling's
      space-y margin, which is exactly the gap that should remain once this card
      is gone.

      One duration for both properties, ease-out, 160ms — an exit is the system
      responding, not the user deciding, so it is the panel's fast state
      duration rather than its travel duration. The reduced-motion block above
      already squashes this to 0.01ms; the caller drops its unmount timer to
      match, so the card leaves at once rather than sitting invisible. */

/* ── Surfaces. The container is rounded-xl + --bg-item-surface +
      --border-subtle, which is the pair every card in this panel carried at
      3e8ea9fa, restored verbatim.

      It is NOT General's dark container. General's is bg-transparent +
      border-transparent, and a pass that copied that here produced hollow
      outlines: General can drop both the fill AND the edge because every one of
      its cards holds a single row, so the row IS the object and the container
      is free to be notional. A provider card is a heading row plus a credential
      row plus an action row plus a nested models disclosure. Four rows with
      nothing behind them do not read as one object — they read as a skeleton,
      and two adjacent skeletons merge into an undifferentiated block. The fill
      is what makes a multi-row card a card; it is not optional here.

      The edge then goes back to --border-subtle, i.e. transparent in dark. With
      the fill restored, a white hairline would encode the same boundary twice
      over a 9-step lift and a 12px radius. In light, --border-subtle is a real
      7% black and does separate work, because the light fill sits BELOW its
      canvas rather than above it. One token, correct in both, by construction.

      Note what General's dark divider really computes to: the
      "divide-border-subtle/20" it asks for emits NO CSS at all (Tailwind 3
      cannot recompute alpha on a bare var() colour — same trap documented at
      src/index.css:63 and tailwind.config.js:23), so its separators fall back
      to preflight's #e5e7eb. Deliberately not reproduced: an authored
      near-white hairline on a #1E1E21 canvas is a bug to inherit, not a
      grammar to match. Dividers here use --aip-divider.

      No box-shadow. General has none in either theme, and the pair this rule
      used to carry never rendered anyway: "box-shadow" is "none | <shadow>#",
      so both "inset 0 1px 0 rgba(...), none" (dark) and "none, 0 1px 1px
      rgba(...)" (light) were invalid declarations and were dropped whole.

        - The row you clicked is the one you are looking at; it is the only place

        - The departing row is frequently off-screen, and animating something

          long over, so it would only ever be seen having already finished.
        - A row quietly GAINING a "Set default" ghost is not something you did.
          Animating it would claim an event that never happened.

      No shared-element "the badge slid across" illusion: that needs FLIP, which
      needs measurement and JS, and the two rows are usually not both on screen —

/* ...and the border must be the ONLY indicator, which means suppressing the panel's
   global ":focus-visible" accent outline here, exactly as ".aip-field > .aip-input"
   already does. Two reasons, both of which this rule was previously only half
   winning — the brightened border was applied but the accent outline still painted
   on top of it:
     CLIPPING. The models filter sits directly inside ".aip-reveal > div", which
     carries overflow:hidden for the collapse animation. An outline at
     "outline-offset: 2px" is drawn 4px OUTSIDE the border box, and the filter is
     flex-1 with its left edge flush to that clip box — so the ring's left arc was
     sliced off square while the right stayed round.
     GRAMMAR. ":focus-visible" matches POINTER focus on text inputs, so a 2px solid
     accent rectangle fired on every click into the field, not on keyboard nav —
     the same "alarm around a field you merely clicked into" the .aip-field comment
     above rejects.
   Keyboard affordance is not lost: --aip-input-border-focus is tuned per theme to
   clear SC 1.4.11's 3:1, which is what the outline was there to guarantee. Nothing
   paints outside the border box now, so no ancestor's overflow can clip it. */
.aip-root .aip-input:focus-visible { outline: none; }

/* Same clip box, the other half of the toolbar. The buttons beside the filter
   (Refresh, Select all, Reset…) sit in the same overflow:hidden row, and the
   last one is flush with its right edge — so the outward outline loses its
   right arc exactly as the input lost its left one.
   Buttons are NOT given the input's treatment: ":focus-visible" does not match
   pointer clicks on a <button>, so here the accent ring is real keyboard
   affordance and removing it would cost a11y for no reason. It is drawn INSIDE
   the border box instead, which is how ".aip-field-seg" and ".aip-tab" already
   solve this — 0,4,0 to beat ".aip-root :focus-visible" (0,2,0).
   Rows inside ".aip-models-well" need no such rule: its padding:4px already

   R-10 resolution card (§19.1). Rendered only while the main process reports
   two credential stores that cannot be ordered (a whole-profile restore left a
   newer app-managed backup beside the OS-keyring file). Until the user answers,
   the app runs from the union of both sets and refuses to overwrite either
   file — safe, but every new key lands in the weaker app-managed store, so the
   state should be ENDED deliberately, here, where keys are managed.
   Shows key NAMES and last-4 only; the main process never sends values.

   What it says is in src/lib/credentialStoresConflict.mjs (unit-tested):
   provider names instead of field names, which keys the two sets disagree on,
   the OS store named for the platform the app is running on, and a sentence
   for every reason main can refuse a choice.

                of one long scroll. Each tab now carries id + aria-controls, each
                panel role="tabpanel" + aria-labelledby + tabIndex, and the list has
                a roving-tabindex key handler (see handleTabKeyDown) — without it a
                keyboard user landed on the active tab and could never leave it.

                Motion is the meeting-notes Summary/Transcript/Usage switcher's
                (MeetingDetails.tsx): the same framer-motion spring, stiffness 400
                / damping 30. Measured here: 2.8% positional overshoot, settled by
                ~640ms, and on an interrupt at +100ms the pill goes 32 -> 23 -> 48
                -> 46 px/frame — it keeps its speed instead of restarting from
                rest, which is what the old `transition-transform` did (a fresh
                full duration eased in from zero velocity, every time). That
                interruption behaviour is the part that actually reads as "the
                same switcher"; the easing curve alone is not.

                What is deliberately NOT copied is MeetingDetails' `layoutId`
                shared-layout element. This pill is ONE node that never unmounts,
                springing `x` across the track. The reason is a real regression the
                layoutId version caused: switching tabs from a scrolled position
                snapped the panel back to the top. No code writes scrollTop (a
                patched setter caught zero writes) — layout projection forces a
                measure pass around the panel unmount/mount, the scroller's content
                transiently collapses below scrollTop + clientHeight, and Chromium
                clamps. Measured in the harness: scrollTop 260 -> 0 with layoutId,
                260 -> 260 with this version, same spring in both. `overflow-anchor:
                none` on SettingsOverlay's scroller means nothing restores it.

                Still transform-only, and the tabs themselves still never restyle
                their background — which is what stops the three-way colour swap
                that a per-button `bg` transition produces. Only the label colour
                crossfades, from `.aip-tab`'s own CSS transition.

                The track's `overflow-hidden` is GONE, and that is load-bearing:
                the spring overshoots by ~13px on the ~465px cloud->privacy hop
                while the track has only 4px of `p-1` plus a ~1px gap to spare, so
                on the end tabs the clip shaved the pill's outer edge flat for ~4
                frames — exactly the part of the meeting-notes feel being ported.
                Nothing else needed the clip: the pill is inset and `rounded-md`
                inside the track's `rounded-lg`, and the labels self-truncate. */}
