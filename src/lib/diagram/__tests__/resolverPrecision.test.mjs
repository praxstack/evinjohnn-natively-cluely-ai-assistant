// ── the fifth held-out measurement (2026-10-02): the final one ──────────────
// 451 sentences by a fifth reviewer (a public-library lending system: an
// architecture, a forecast, an ER diagram, a state diagram), frozen before the
// rules were run (SHA-256 41a44a45…00a2): 212 of 224 "must not" lines right
// (5.4% wrong; 3.7% without the rows marked borderline), 203 of 227 "must"
// lines right (10.6% missed), nothing over 100 ms. That is the figure for the
// rules as they stood before this set was seen.
//
// Afterwards the false claims that would have REDRAWN a diagram were fixed (an
// edit is judged by its own object: "remove the HOLD music", "put the caller
// ON HOLD", "I need a COPY of the signed contract", "remove Dan from the EMAIL
// thread"), with a few cheap misses. The rows below are still wrong, and are
