// there is no per-route diagram memory to drift apart. It follows the
// tracker's own lifetime: cleared on a new meeting, a mode switch and a
// session reset, and it expires on its own after a quiet half hour.
//
// It keeps the minimum a follow-up needs: the latest valid Mermaid source, its
// view, and a parent/version identity. Earlier answers are never rewritten —
// an update is a NEW version attached to the answer that produced it.
//
// "Valid" here means it passed the static policy check (diagramPolicy). The
// main process cannot run Mermaid's parser; if the renderer later repairs a
// block, applyRepair() swaps the stored source for the working one.
