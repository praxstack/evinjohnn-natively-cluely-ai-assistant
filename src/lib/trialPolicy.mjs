// What to do with an EXPIRED free-trial token (toaster policy Phase 0,
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-toaster-policy-design.md §5, §9).
//
// The token deliberately survives expiry: it is how the next launch knows to
// show the "Trial ended" card to someone who quit before seeing it. But it
// also survived a PURCHASE. A user who let the trial run out and then bought
// a licence, saved a real Natively key or saved their own AI key kept the dead
// token, so every launch wiped their résumé/JD data and opened a card that
// cannot be closed and whose only exit ("Use my own API keys") deactivates the
// licence they just paid for.
//
// Pure and platform-free, so every branch is testable; applied in one place in
// the main process (settleExpiredTrial in ipcHandlers.ts).

 *   trial (the caller records which trial was wiped).
 * - A trial with time left is never touched.
