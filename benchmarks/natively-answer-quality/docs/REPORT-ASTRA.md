# Natively answer quality — report after phase 3 (judge gpt-6-astra, charter v2)

Status 2026-10-02 12:04 UTC. Generator: deepseek-flash. Judge: gpt-6-astra through AgentRouter, charter v2
`c725615a54f6` (claim kinds), calibration 25 of 25. Every score in this report is under charter v2; nothing from
charter v1 is mixed in. Holdout is reported in aggregate only.

## 0. Status on 2026-10-02 15:30 UTC — what was decided today, and what is still being judged

gpt-6-astra answered again at 11:02 UTC (key `AGENTROUTER_API_KEY`; calibration 25 of 25; every call answered by
`gpt-6-astra`, 0 model mismatches). The decisions were judged first.

**The four prepared changes were judged against the rules written for them beforehand. None passes; none is built.**
Rule: on the dev replay pair, gain of at least +0.3, 95 % interval excluding 0, hard fails not up.

| change | rows | base | variant | gain (95 %) | hard fails | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Reasoning before a typed answer, Technical interview + Lecture (`fix/aq-astra-i7`, `3b0c1a4f`) | 80 | 8.40 | 8.58 | +0.18 (±0.25) | 14 → 13 | do not build |
| Looking for work: the claim pass's rule for a reply left unanswered (`fix/aq-astra-i6`, `c399f399`) | 40 | 7.98 | 8.13 | +0.15 (±0.33) | 7 → 6 | do not build |
| Call Center: "no policy on file" notice on heard turns (same branch) | 40 | 7.47 | 7.89 | +0.42 (±0.48) | 9 → 7 | do not build |
| Sales: reply-shape notice on heard turns (same branch) | 40 | 8.12 | 8.43 | +0.31 (±0.36) | 4 → 1 | do not build |

All four point the same way and none can be told from zero on 40 items a mode (section 9, item 6). Both branches
stay unmerged. The kept build is unchanged: **fix13 (`e000db4a`)**, and its own re-run rows are now judged
(against fix12: dev +1.13 ±0.79 on 17 rows, holdout +1.07 ±1.62 on 10 rows; kept).

**Reasoning was the one lever with a consistent signal. Evin decided against it on 2026-10-02 (about 13:50 UTC):
the point of Natively is to answer fast. It is not built.** The quality reads, reported only:

| Technical interview + Lecture, reasoning at low effort | rows | off | on | gain (95 %) | hard fails |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| typed turns only, dev (the pair above) | 80 | 8.40 | 8.58 | +0.18 (±0.25) | 14 → 13 |
| typed turns only, holdout | 60 | 8.31 | 8.63 | +0.33 (±0.31) | 12 → 9 |
| every turn, dev | 80 | 8.40 | 8.85 | +0.45 (±0.42) | 14 → 9 |
| every turn, holdout | 60 | 8.31 | 8.72 | +0.42 (±0.61) | 12 → 6 |

The cost, measured on 431 prompts through AgentRouter's DeepSeek route (off / low effort / default effort): first
answer token at 1.17 / 2.49 / 3.69 s at the median and 2.23 / 5.76 / 8.04 s at p95; on hard questions 1.24 / 3.12 /
4.46 s; the first word is later than 2 s on 8 % / 69 % / 92 % of turns; output tokens 95 / 405 / 660. The same
prompt answers 1.31 s later at the median and 4.82 s at p95 with low-effort reasoning. In the app on the direct
route the typed-turn first word moved from 0.70 s to 1.67 s. `fix/aq-astra-i7` stays unmerged.

**The starting baseline is now judged in full**, so the headline no longer rests on a partial comparison: dev
7.76 → 8.54 (+0.78 ±0.22), hard fails 89 → 37 of 360; holdout 7.92 → 8.47 (+0.55 ±0.25), hard fails 61 → 31 of 270.

**The candidates' app rows, judged later in the same batch and reported only** (each candidate build against the
kept build, paired by item; a different generation sample on every row, so these are noisier than the replay pairs):

| candidate in the app | dev: gain (95 %) | hard fails | holdout: gain (95 %) | hard fails |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Reasoning, the typed Technical interview + Lecture rows (31 / 21) | +0.47 (±0.51) | 3 → 1 | +0.33 (±0.73) | 2 → 2 |
| the same build's heard rows — unchanged code, a second sample (49 / 39) | +0.05 (±0.52) | 10 → 9 | −0.53 (±0.71) | 4 → 10 |
| Looking for work, fallback rule (40 / 30) | +0.22 (±0.36) | 7 → 7 | +0.37 (±0.44) | 7 → 5 |
| Call Center notice (40 / 30) | +0.57 (±0.62) | 7 → 4 | +0.46 (±0.80) | 5 → 2 |
| Sales notice (40 / 30) | −0.09 (±0.66) | 3 → 5 | −0.20 (±0.69) | 3 → 3 |

They agree with the verdicts: nothing clears its interval, and the Sales notice reads negative in the app. The
second row is the caution for every other line: the same code, sampled again, moved by half a point and from 4 to
10 hard fails on 39 holdout rows.

**One more test of the Call Center notice, on items the judge had never seen (I29, 13:42 UTC).** At Evin's
"continue iterations" the one candidate a larger set could decide was tested once more: the final set's 116 Call
Center rows, split into two halves, three samples per touched row, rule written before any answer was generated.

| half | rows | base | with the notice | gain (95 %) | hard fails | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| decision | 47 | 7.70 | 8.37 | +0.67 (±0.42) | 23 → 6 | pass |
| confirmation | 68 | 7.99 | 8.17 | +0.18 (±0.25) | 20 → 12 | fail — interval includes 0 |

Both halves had to pass, so the notice is not promoted. It lowers hard fails on both halves; its effect on the
score did not repeat.

**Left in the judge queue, none of it able to change a decision:** the rest of the blind pairwise set (fix6 against
fix11, 276 of 360 done), fix10, and five reported-only replays. They are not armed for the 02:00 UTC batch.

**Speed (Evin, 2026-10-02: "the point of natively is to answer fast").** On heard turns the app waits before it
sends the request: 200 ms at the median and 437 ms at p90 across heard turns in Looking for work, Technical
interview and Seminar; 302 / 487 ms when a profile is loaded; typed turns 7 ms. The app's own stage trace puts it
on one step, the bundled cross-encoder rerank (250 ms p50, 405 p90, on 30 of 38 lookups that reach its gate),
which has been on by default for users since 2026-08-30. With it switched off through its own setting the wait is
16 / 37 ms, and the retrieved passages sent to the model are identical on 88 of the 93 rows that carry any. The
five turns where the passages do differ, replayed five times each way, read 6.18 with the rerank and 7.49 without
(five items: no loss visible, not a gain). A whole-run judged pair exists and is not usable: the provider stalled
during the rerank-off run. Re-run back to back on 2026-10-03 with a healthy provider: heard first word 1.08 s with the
rerank, 0.81 s without. **Evin's decision (2026-10-03): keep it as it is today.** Nothing is changed. Details: `docs/ITERATIONS-ASTRA.md`, the "Speed" sections.

**A caveat on every run in this report, checked and found harmless.** The default local embedder's weights were
missing from the benchmark worktrees (and from the main checkout), so profile lookups ran degraded in every run.
With the embedder working, the same 120 judged dev rows read 8.38 → 8.24 (−0.15 ±0.25): no gain, so the
profile-backed modes' numbers are not understated.

**The laptop's disk.** Free space fell to 0.29 GB at 11:06 UTC while another session was building, and stopped the
first calibration. The judge now holds its calls through such a dip and its files survive a write cut short
(`astra/store.mjs`); no app run is started under 4 GB free. What is idle on the disk and belongs to other work
(build output, an 8.3 GB `release` folder in the main checkout) is listed in `docs/ITERATIONS-ASTRA.md`.

The generator stays on the direct DeepSeek key (Evin, 05:05 UTC). A second judge (Fable) was tried for about an
hour on 2026-10-02 at Evin's request and withdrawn at Evin's request; its scores are in the repository as a record
(`abs-*-f1`, `*.judged-fable.jsonl`) and none is used in this report.

## 1. Outcome

* **Kept build: `fix13` = app commit `e000db4a` on branch `fix/aq-astra-i5`. Landed on local main on 2026-10-03
  (merge `98caa240`; not pushed; every score here was measured before that merge, see the handoff, section 4).**
  fix13 is fix12
  (`f0c3a263`) plus one prompt notice that touches 7 of 360 dev rows and 4 of 270 holdout rows.
* **From main as it was at the start to the kept build, every answer judged on both sides:**

  | | start | kept build | paired gain (95 %) | hard fails |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | dev (360) | 7.76 | 8.54 | +0.78 (±0.22) | 89 → 37 |
  | holdout (270) | 7.92 | 8.47 | +0.55 (±0.25) | 61 → 31 |

  Against the earlier reference (fix6): holdout +0.45 (±0.22), hard fails 60 → 31; dev +0.30 (±0.17), 66 → 37.
* **No mode is at 9.5, and none will get there by fixing failures.** Highest: Team Meet 9.16, Seminar 9.02 and
  Recruiting 9.01 on dev; General 8.97 on holdout. Lowest: Call Center 7.63 / 7.93 and Looking for work
  7.92 / 7.74. The 78–79 % of answers with no flagged failure average 9.28 (dev) and 9.26 (holdout); with every
  failure class fully repaired the modes would land between 8.5 (Call Center) and 9.5 (Technical interview,
  Lecture). See section 9.
* **No mode is worse than at the start beyond its interval.** Section 3 has the per-mode paired table; the two
  negative holdout lines are Team Meet −0.18 (±0.61) and Lecture −0.07 (±0.59).
* **The last round found nothing to add.** Four prepared changes were judged on 2026-10-02 and none passed its
  rule (section 0). The one lever with a consistent signal, the generator reasoning before it answers in Technical
  interview and Lecture, costs about a second on the first word and is a product decision.
* Price of the gain: the answer settles about 0.5–0.7 s later at the median (time to first word unchanged) and the
  text shown is replaced after streaming on 24–31 % of turns. That trade is Evin's to accept or change (section 9).

fix12 is a composite for reporting: its only difference from fix11 is one Seminar-only clause in the verifier
prompt (every other mode's prompt is byte-identical, checked), so only Seminar was re-run and re-judged; the other
eight modes are fix11's runs and judgments (`tools/compose-run.mjs`, runs `aq2-*-fix12c`).

## 2. Iterations: attempted, kept, reverted

46 changes were tried (one of them, the Call Center notice, twice); 26 are in the kept build, 20 were rejected, taken back or not built. Every one is described, with its
evidence, in `docs/ITERATIONS-ASTRA.md`; every dev question with each run's answer is in `docs/ITERATIONS-QA.md`.

**In the kept build (26):** I1 small corpus read whole · I2 hidden arithmetic scratch block · I3 the user's own
life is remembered, not checked · I4 the recruiting hotkey is the interviewer's spoken words · I5 own-life rule
only in the job modes · I6 a heard question about the user's own life is theirs to answer · I7 no product material
→ no product facts · I8 claim verifier · I8b no-document product clause ·
I8c highlights kept, formatting-only edit is no edit · I9 Recruiting heard turns never plan as coding · I10 Call
Center states the rule, then verifies · I11 "Today" line · I13 Team Meet wording (superseded by I15) · I14 document
freshness status · I15 spoken replies do not open by reporting their notes · I16 no question handed back when
something answers · I18 the verifier lists, then rewrites; Team Meet and Recruiting verified · language rail ·
I21 every spoken General turn verified · I22 every Seminar turn verified · tidy edits · claim kinds (decisions,
ownership, small commitments are not claims; a conflict is surfaced) · source-word rail · I25 Seminar study scope ·
I26 a typed "shorter" / "simpler" / "another one" revises the previous reply.

**Rejected, taken back or not built (20):** conflict wording · past-event notice · "use the specifics" · I13 wording in
the app · I17 removing the Today line · scratch-v2 · I19 technical second look · I20 missing-facts line · I23 "what
to say instead" · I24 early stop · a larger generator · the general honest-limit exemption (built as `e7325287`,
judged −0.02 ±0.24, reverted) · "an older version is not a conflict" · "keep every can't" in Call Center · gate-v2
(verify Lecture / Technical interview turns that carry a personal claim) · a Lecture voice rewrite · and the four
judged on 2026-10-02, none of which cleared its rule (section 0): I28 reasoning on typed Technical interview and
Lecture turns · the Looking-for-work fallback rule · the Call Center "no policy on file" notice · the Sales
reply-shape notice.

**Promotion history under charter v2.** fix6 was the provisional reference. fix11 (fix6 + I16, I18, language rail,
I21, I22, claim kinds, source rail) cleared holdout by +0.42 (±0.22) and failed one pre-registered rule: a
supp-behavior validator the verifier itself broke. fix12 repairs that with one clause and was promoted on its own
holdout read. The holdout result confirms the bundle, not each part: by attribution on dev and holdout, the gain is
I18's list-then-rewrite (fix9: +0.30 ±0.25 on holdout over fix6); claim kinds are judged neutral and are kept for
what they do objectively (fewer edits, no decision turned into a question).

## 3. Scores, p10 and hard fails per mode

Every column is judged in full under charter v2 (gpt-6-astra). Main = main as it was at the start; fix6 = the earlier
reference; fix13 = the kept build (`e000db4a`), reported as fix12's rows plus the rows fix13 re-ran (`aq2-*-fix13c`).

Regression read: no mode is down with its interval excluding 0. Lecture is flat on both sets (the claim verifier
does not run there) and its hard fails went 3 → 4 and 2 → 3; the flags are in the hard-fail tables below
(`astra/paired.mjs`).

## 5. Claim verifier: invocation rate and replacement rate

Invocation = the turn passes the verifier's gate (mode, surface, question, draft). Replacement = the shown text differs from the streamed draft.

**fix13 (dev)**

| Mode | turns | verifier runs | text replaced | spoken turns replaced |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| General | 40 | 19 (48%) | 8 (20%) | 8/19 |

| Lecture | 40 | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) | 0/20 |
| Technical interview | 40 | 8 (20%) | 4 (10%) | 4/29 |
| Seminar | 40 | 40 (100%) | 8 (20%) | 5/32 |
| Call Center | 40 | 40 (100%) | 21 (53%) | 15/30 |
| **All** | 360 | 267 (74%) | 111 (31%) | 91/245 |

**fix13 (holdout)**

| Mode | turns | verifier runs | text replaced | spoken turns replaced |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| General | 30 | 17 (57%) | 7 (23%) | 6/16 |
| Sales | 30 | 30 (100%) | 7 (23%) | 5/21 |
| Recruiting | 30 | 30 (100%) | 7 (23%) | 5/21 |
| Team Meet | 30 | 30 (100%) | 6 (20%) | 3/21 |

**What the claim pass does to the answers it edits** — the same turn judged twice, once with the streamed draft and
once with the answer shown after the pass (`tools/edit-pairs.mjs`, `tools/edit-effect.mjs`; judged 2026-10-02):

| answers the claim pass edited (kept build) | rows | streamed draft | shown answer | change (95 %) | hard fails | worse by 1+ | better by 1+ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| dev, all edited rows | 111 | 6.58 | 7.72 | +1.14 (±0.39) | 56 → 17 | 9 | 44 |
| dev, the draft had a hard fail | 56 | 4.46 | 6.94 | +2.48 (±0.48) | 56 → 16 | 0 | 40 |
| dev, the draft had none | 55 | 8.74 | 8.51 | −0.23 (±0.34) | 0 → 1 | 9 | 4 |
| holdout, all edited rows | 66 | 5.87 | 7.55 | +1.68 (±0.53) | 43 → 15 | 2 | 30 |
| holdout, the draft had a hard fail | 43 | 4.33 | 6.88 | +2.56 (±0.63) | 43 → 15 | 0 | 28 |
| holdout, the draft had none | 23 | 8.76 | 8.81 | +0.05 (±0.48) | 0 → 0 | 2 | 2 |

The pass removes a hard fail from 40 of 56 edited dev answers and 28 of 43 on holdout, and adds one in 55 + 23 edits
of answers that had none. Where the draft was already sound its edit is roughly neutral (dev −0.23 ±0.34, holdout
+0.05 ±0.48): 9 dev answers lose a point or more and 4 gain one. That neutral half is the cost side of the swap the
user sees (section 9, item 3).

## 6. Latency impact in one line

Time to first word: unchanged (against fix6: dev 854 → 875 ms, holdout 779 → 871 ms at the median; against main at the start it is faster, 990 → 875 and 965 → 871 ms; the verifier runs after the stream). Total time to the settled answer: dev 1555 → 2023 ms (+0.47 s), holdout 1485 → 2138 ms (+0.65 s) at the median against fix6, and 1498 → 2023 (+0.53 s) and 1438 → 2138 ms (+0.70 s) against main at the start; p95 2761 → 3413 and 2811 → 3665 ms. The verifier passes its gate on 74–75% of turns and replaces the shown text on 31% (dev) / 24% (holdout); on spoken turns 91 of 245 and 52 of 189.

## 7. The 20 worst remaining dev answers (kept build)

**DGEN-036** — General — 3.9 — arithmetic_error, major_reasoning_error, reference_conflict_ignored, missed_available_evidence, important_question_unanswered

> Q: And just so you're aware, if you weren't planning to renew you needed to give us sixty days, so that window's pretty much closed.
>
> A: The notice window doesn't change the rent number. The lease caps any renewal increase at 3%, and 3% of my current rent is two thousand two hundred sixty-five, not two thousand two fifty. So let's settle the increase first, and then we can talk about whether I'm renewing.

*Judge:* Instead of addressing the notice dispute, it repeats incorrect arithmetic and treats a cap as an exact required price, while ignoring conflicting notice periods, end dates, and rent figures.

**DGEN-012** — General — 4.0 — unsupported_policy_claim

> Q: Hi, this is Maria from the fraud team at your bank. We've blocked a suspicious charge of eight hundred forty dollars. To reverse it I just need you to read me the six digit code we just texted you.
>
> A: I'm not going to read out that code. My bank doesn't ask for one-time codes over the phone, and a real fraud team wouldn't need it to reverse a charge. I'll hang up and call the number on the back of my card to check this directly.

*Judge:* The refusal and independent callback are appropriate, but the claims about this bank's code policy and what its fraud team would need assert procedures that were not supplied.

**DGEN-035** — General — 4.0 — arithmetic_error, major_reasoning_error, reference_conflict_ignored

> Q: Hi Sam, it's Doug from Brightwater, just calling about your renewal. Rent's going to two thousand two fifty starting next term, which is in line with your lease.
>
> A: Two thousand two fifty is a 4.5% increase on my current rent, and the lease caps any renewal increase at 3%, which would put it at two thousand two hundred sixty-five. Can you walk me through how you got to that number?

*Judge:* It ignores conflicting rent figures and miscalculates the increase and cap. The actual 3% ceilings are $2,214.50 or $2,266; the gist also contradicts the answer by claiming $2,250 exceeds its stated $2,265 ceiling.

**DSALES-002** — Sales — 4.0 — unsupported_company_claim

> Q: How much?
>
> A: Before I put a number on it, it depends on how many people would be using it and which parts you'd need. Let me confirm the exact pricing for your setup and walk you through it on our next call.

*Judge:* It asserts that pricing depends on user count and required components without supporting evidence, then unnecessarily postpones the price discussion to another call.

**DSALES-035** — Sales — 4.0 — major_factual_error, unsupported_company_claim, missed_available_evidence

> Q: Why not?
>
> A: Because I don't control the date, your data does. Growth onboarding runs 4 to 6 weeks from signature, and that clock only starts once we have clean technician, customer and asset data in the first 10 business days. If we sign this week and your data lands quickly, November 1 is realistic. So the real question is your data readiness. Can we get your data owner on a short call tomorrow to confirm what's ready?

*Judge:* It incorrectly says the onboarding clock starts upon data receipt; the source measures from signature, conditional on timely clean data. This materially changes the timeline. It also largely repeats the previous answer instead of briefly explaining the constraint.

**DSALES-024** — Sales — 4.0 — unsafe_commitment

> Q: This sheet says go-live is guaranteed within thirty days. I'm going to need that written into the contract.
>
> A: I want to be straight with you on that one. The sheet does say go-live within 30 days of signature, but it's marked with an asterisk, and the footnote reads that timelines are estimates and depend on customer data readiness. So I can't put it in the contract as an unconditional guarantee. What I can do is commit to the 30-day target in writing and tie it to a data readiness checklist we agree on upfront, so the clock

*Judge:* It correctly explains the caveat, but offers to commit to a written 30-day target without confirming contractual authority or current terms from this expired sheet.

**DJOB-005** — Looking for work — 4.0 — fabricated_behavioral_story, unsupported_personal_claim, important_question_unanswered

> Q: Tell me about a project that didn't go the way you wanted. Maybe you missed a deadline, or shipped something that had to be rolled back. What happened, what was your part in it, and what did you change afterward?
>
> A: The honest one is Project Tern. I was tech lead on the carrier-settlement rewrite, a working group of 4 engineers and 1 QA analyst over 7 months, moving the Rails monolith into three Go services. What I'd say I took from it is writing the edge cases into the design doc first and getting sign-off before anyone wrote code.

*Judge:* The résumé supports Tern’s scope and leadership, not that it went badly or produced this lesson. The answer invents that framing and takeaway while never explaining what failed or the candidate’s responsibility.

**DJOB-016** — Looking for work — 4.0 — unsupported_personal_claim, fabricated_behavioral_story

> Q: How do you usually work with QA when you're in the middle of a big rewrite and everything's moving?
>
> A: On Project Tern I worked with one QA analyst across the whole seven-month rewrite, and the thing that made it work was keeping her in the loop from the design doc onward, not just at the end. We agreed early on what the contract tests had to cover, so she could build against the new Go services while the old Rails path was still live. That way we weren't saving all the verification for a big-bang cutover.

*Judge:* The résumé supports Tern’s duration and QA staffing, but not early design involvement, agreed contract-test coverage, parallel Rails/Go testing, or cutover practices. These invented details supply most of the behavioral answer.

**DJOB-018** — Looking for work — 4.0 — major_factual_error

> Q: Years of experience?
>
> A: I've been working as a backend engineer since 2020. I started at Brindlecap Labs in 2020 on a Python/Django inventory tool, and since mid-2021 I've been at Quillfeather Health building Kotlin services, mostly around scheduling and reliable messaging.

*Judge:* It treats the November 2022 résumé as current, falsely saying Tobias is still at Quillfeather despite his documented move to Larkspur in March 2023. The unnecessary chronology makes a simple answer misleading.

**DLEC-038** — Lecture — 4.0 — major_reasoning_error

> Q: And that's the same logic behind why cartels like the one we looked at last week keep falling apart.
>
> A: Cartels are the repeated-game version of the dilemma, and the reason they break down is that the conditions for cooperation don't really hold. A cartel works only if every member keeps output low and prices high, but each firm has a short-term gain from undercutting while the others hold the line. That temptation is the defection payoff, and it's always there. What makes it worse is that cartels can't rely on the end

*Judge:* An uncertain possibility of cartel breakup is not a known final round. The answer incorrectly invokes backward induction and suggests imperfect monitoring or delayed punishment prevents repeated-game cooperation, although sufficiently credible future penalties can sustain it.

**DLEC-012** — Lecture — 4.0 — arithmetic_error

> Q: using the slides' method, what's the elasticity if the cart cuts the price from 3.60 back to 3.00 and sales go from 400 back up to 500?
>
> A: Same range, so the same answer: |E| = 1.22, elastic. The midpoint formula gives the same number whichever direction the price moves, so cutting from $3.60 back to $3.00 with sales rising from 400 to 500 is just the Slide 5 example run in reverse. The percentage changes are -22.2% for quantity and 18.2% for price, and 22.2 divided by 18.2 is 1.22.

*Judge:* The final elasticity and classification are correct, but both percentage changes have the wrong signs for the requested reversal. This makes the worked explanation mathematically misleading despite its correct conclusion.

**DLEC-023** — Lecture — 4.0 — major_factual_error, missed_available_evidence

> Q: the handout says the coffee cart is unit elastic at -1.00 but I'm pretty sure she said elastic in lecture. which one is right, what should I write on the midterm, and why would they come out different?
>
> A: Write elastic. The handout's own classification line says that for this course, unit elastic counts as elastic, and the coffee cart example lands at E = -1.00, so it's elastic by that rule. That's also why it sounds like a contradiction: -1.00 is the boundary value, and the handout is telling you to file it on the elastic side rather than treat it as its own category. They come out different because "unit elastic" is

*Judge:* The exam label follows the handout, but the answer wrongly endorses identical revenue implications for unit-elastic and elastic demand. It also omits the method distinction: original-value elasticity is -1.00; midpoint elasticity is approximately -1.22.

**DTECH-005** — Technical interview — 4.0 — major_factual_error

> Q: Here's a quick one. Someone wrote a Java method to check if two strings are anagrams. It turns both into char arrays, sorts both with Arrays.sort, and then returns first dot equals second. It returns false even for liste
>
> A: The bug is that `Arrays.sort` on a `char[]` sorts in place and returns `void`, so `first` and `second` are still the original unsorted arrays. Comparing them with `.equals` on arrays is also reference equality, not content equality, so it returns false even when the contents match. Here's the fix: ```java boolean isAnagram(String a, String b) { if (a.length() != b.length()) return false; char[] first = a.toCharArray(

*Judge:* The opening falsely claims the arrays remain unsorted because Arrays.sort returns void, contradicting Java's in-place behavior and the final explanation. The actual equality diagnosis and supplied code are correct.

**DTECH-007** — Technical interview — 4.0 — major_reasoning_error

> Q: Don't write code yet. Count the islands in a grid of ones and zeros, except the grid is huge, millions of rows, and you can only stream it one row at a time with memory for about two rows. How would you approach it?
>
> A: The key constraint is that I can't hold the whole grid, so I can't do a normal flood fill. What I can do is keep a running label for each cell in the current row, and only ever compare it against the row above. So I process one row at a time. For each row, I look at the cells that are 1 and figure out which of them connect to a 1 directly above them in the previous row. Cells that touch a labeled component above inhe

*Judge:* Final root counting conflicts with recycling: closed islands disappear from the result, while retaining every root can exceed the memory limit. Path compression and rank do not fix this. Time complexity is omitted.

**DTECH-035** — Technical interview — 4.0 — major_factual_error

> Q: interviewer says this is wrong for some inputs, fix it: def length_of_longest_substring(s): seen = {} left = 0 best = 0 for right, ch in enumerate(s): if ch in seen: left = seen[ch] + 1 seen[ch] = right best = max(best, 
>
> A: The bug is that `enumerate(s)` yields `(index, char)` tuples, so `ch` is never in `seen`, and `right` is never defined. On `"abcabcbb"` it crashes with a NameError. You want the index as the loop variable and the character as the key. ```python def length_of_longest_substring(s): seen = {} left = 0 best = 0 for right, ch in enumerate(s): if ch in seen and seen[ch] >= left: left = seen[ch] + 1 seen[ch] = right best = 

*Judge:* The patch and final explanation are correct, but the opening falsely claims the already-unpacked loop leaves right undefined and crashes on 'abcabcbb'. The gist repeats the nonexistent unpacking issue.

**DTECH-021** — Technical interview — 4.0 — major_reasoning_error

> Q: What's the time complexity of this: the outer loop runs i from one to n, and inside it j starts at i and doubles each time while j is less than n, doing constant work per step.
>
> A: The outer loop runs n times, and for each i the inner loop doubles j from i up to n, which is about log(n/i) steps. Summing that over i gives O(n log n) overall, and the space is O(1) since it's just the two counters.

*Judge:* O(n log n) is a valid but loose upper bound, not the tight complexity this question calls for. The summation is Θ(n); both the answer and gist miss the central insight.

**DTECH-013** — Technical interview — 4.0 — major_reasoning_error, unsupported_personal_claim, important_question_unanswered

> Q: Tell me about Project Tern. Why split settlement into three services instead of keeping one, and how did you cut over without paying a carrier twice?
>
> A: I led Project Tern, a rewrite of our carrier-settlement service from a Rails monolith into three Go services. I coordinated a working group of 4 engineers and 1 QA analyst over 7 months. On the cutover, the thing that protected us was the reconciliation job. It compares carrier invoices against booked loads nightly. We drove monthly mismatches from 312 down to 41.

*Judge:* It omits the split rationale and invents a cutover role for the reconciliation job; nightly invoice/load comparison does not itself prevent duplicate payouts.

**DTECH-028** — Technical interview — 4.0 — major_factual_error, unsupported_company_claim, missed_available_evidence

> Q: So if you joined and owned this, what would you change first, how would you know it worked, and what would you leave alone?
>
> A: The first thing I'd change is the threshold, not the paging. One percent for five minutes is the same bar for a tier-1 checkout service and a low-traffic internal one, so I'd tier it by service criticality and traffic, and add a deploy-aware suppression window so the half that fire during deploys and clear on their own stop waking people up. I'd know it worked by watching pages per week drop from around 90 while the 

*Judge:* It invents existing multi-window burn-rate alerting despite the stated fixed-threshold setup, then proposes preserving it. Deploy suppression risks hiding real regressions, and “keep their coverage” provides no concrete success measure.

**DTECH-034** — Technical interview — 4.0 — major_reasoning_error

> Q: Now say windows arrive one at a time from a stream, and the pager can ask is minute t quiet at any moment. What changes in your design?
>
> A: The batch design doesn't survive, because there's no full list to sort. I'd keep the merged windows in a structure ordered by start, so each new window is inserted and merged against its neighbors in place, and "is minute t quiet" becomes a lookup for the window containing t. That's O(log n) per insert and per query instead of one O(n log n) pass.

*Judge:* The claimed O(log n) per insertion ignores merging k existing intervals. With ordinary balanced-tree deletions this takes O((k+1) log n); a logarithmic amortized bound needs explicit qualification.

**DCC-006** — Call Center — 4.0 — unsupported_policy_claim, important_question_unanswered

> Q: I'm calling for my mom, it's her account, she's right here but she can't really hear on the phone. Can you reset her password and send the link to my email instead?
>
> A: I can help with the reset. Since she's right there, can she confirm her name, date of birth, and the email on the account for me?

*Judge:* Invents a name/date-of-birth/email verification procedure without supporting policy and leaves the central request to send the reset link to a third party’s email unanswered.

## 8. Final regression set and supplementary sets

* Final set (1,038 items, objective read, aggregate only, not judged) — kept build `aq2-final-fix13`, one pass, no
  stall:

  | run | failed rows | validators | TTFT p50 / p95 ms | total p50 / p95 ms | text replaced |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | main at the start (`aq-final-base`) | 0 | 13 of 16 | 825 / 1338 | 1249 / 2017 | 2% |
  | fix6 (`aq2-final-fix6`) | 0 | 14 of 16 | 728 / 1196 | 1381 / 2404 | 18% |
  | **fix13** (`aq2-final-fix13`) | 0 | 14 of 16 | 908 / 1336 | 2068 / 3003 | 21% (183 of 681 spoken turns) |

  The two fix13 validator failures (one Lecture, one Call Center) are answers the verifier did not edit and whose
  draft already failed: the generator's own reasoning, not a regression of the changes. Over-verification signs on
  1,038 rows: 220 edits, 13 end in a question (fix6: 35), 15 flagged "decision lost" (7), 19 cut to under half (3).
* Refinement follow-ups (I26, `tools/refine-check.mjs`, objective): a typed "shorter" / "simpler" / "another one"
  was met 2 of 8 times on dev in the main-code run, 1 of 8 in fix11 and 8 of 8 in fix13; on holdout 2 of 6 in fix11
  and 4 of 4 (the ones that get the notice) in fix13; on the final set 5 of 9 in fix6 and 9 of 9 in fix13. "Shorter" now returns a median 52% of the previous reply's
  words (92–96% before).
* supp-behavior (72), judged 2026-10-02: fix6 8.11 → fix11 8.33, +0.23 (±0.37), hard fails 17 → 11; the 10 Seminar
  rows fix12 re-ran: 9.21 → 9.34, +0.13 (±0.29), no hard fail on either side. Validators: fix12 8 of 9 (fix6 8 of 9). The one failure is an unedited Lecture answer (Lecture
  has no verifier). Seminar: 5 of 5 (fix11 3 of 5, fix6 4 of 5).
* supp-quant (32), arithmetic validators: main 25 of 32; later builds 28–31 of 32 (fix6 31, fix10 29, fix12 30) —
  the same code path since I2, the spread is sampling.
* Judged on 2026-10-02: the 2 dev Seminar rows of fix12, the whole starting baseline (dev 159, holdout 68 rows that
  were missing), the claim pass on its edited rows (section 5), supp-behavior, and the candidates' app rows
  (section 0, reported only). In the queue behind them: the blind A/B fix6 vs fix11, fix10, five reported-only
  replays.

## 9. Remaining architectural weaknesses (stop condition B)

**How far failures explain the gap** (`astra/headroom.mjs`, kept build, from the existing judgments). Each answer is
put in one class by its flags; "if fixed" is the set's mean if that class scored like the clean answers.

| | dev (360) | holdout (270) |
|---|---:|---:|
| mean | 8.54 | 8.47 |
| clean answers (no flagged failure): share, mean | 79%, 9.28 | 78%, 9.26 |
| clean answers at 9.5 or above | 132 of 283 | 99 of 211 |
| if the generator's own errors were fixed (item 2) | 8.75 | 8.61 |
| if unsupported company / policy / research claims were (item 4) | 8.69 | 8.73 |
| if "no stored answer" answers were (item 1) | 8.88 | 8.76 |
| if missed-evidence answers were (item 5) | 8.59 | 8.57 |

Clean mean per mode (dev / holdout): General 9.24 / 9.33 · Sales 9.00 / 9.10 · Recruiting 9.41 / 9.27 · Team Meet
9.39 / 9.44 · Looking for work 9.25 / 9.19 · Lecture 9.53 / 9.49 · Technical interview 9.55 / 9.26 · Seminar 9.42 /
9.30 · Call Center 8.54 / 8.94. That is the ceiling of fixing failures. What the judge takes off a clean answer is
intent fulfilment and direct usefulness (7.5–7.8 on the answers under 9.5, in every mode; correctness and grounding
are 9.0–9.3): right and grounded, but not fully what was asked. Its suggested improvements are item-specific; the one
rule-shaped pattern among them, refinement follow-ups, is fixed in I26.

The loop stops changing production code here. What is left needs design work, not another rule; each item is
written up with the measurements, a proposal, expected benefit and risk in `docs/BLOCKERS-ASTRA.md`.

1. **Questions only the user can answer** (why they left, what they want, a weakness, a story; an introduction with
   no profile). The generator invents; the verifier removes the invention and what is left is a deflection. On dev,
   from fix6 to fix11, the judge's "question left unanswered" flag went 11 → 34 while invented-claim flags went
   55 → 23. Proposal: a
   personal answer bank in Profile Intelligence, retrieved before generation. This is the largest remaining lever
   for Looking for work (7.7–7.9) and for the no-profile turns of Sales, Recruiting and Seminar.
2. *(measured after this list was written)* **The generator runs with its reasoning switched off on every turn**
   (`thinking: disabled`, for a fast first word). With reasoning on at low effort the complexity question every
   build got wrong is right in 4 of 5 samples (0 of 5 off). Cost, measured with streaming on 30 Technical interview
   and Lecture prompts: first answer token 0.78 s → 2.22 s at the median, p95 1.0 s → 6.6 s. Judged on 2026-10-02
   (section 0): on typed turns only it did not clear its rule (dev +0.18 ±0.25); on every turn it reads +0.45
   (±0.42) on dev and +0.42 (±0.61) on holdout with hard fails 14 → 9 and 12 → 6. It is the cheapest lever for
   item 2 and a routing decision, because of the delay.
2. **The generator's own reasoning errors** (arithmetic, complexity, a wrong trace): 15 of the 38 dev hard fails
   and 7 of the 31 on holdout, mostly Technical interview and Lecture. A second look by the same model did not find them and a larger
   model of the same family scored no better. Proposal: code execution that gates the answer (the module exists but
   runs after the answer is shown and is off), and a stronger reasoning model for those two modes.
3. **The verifier replaces text the user is already reading** (24–30% of turns, ~0.9 s after the last word).
   Options: hold the answer until verified, or show the change as a visible diff. A product decision.
4. **Call Center with no policy document** (5 of 30 holdout hard fails, all `unsupported_policy_claim`): with no
   policy in the material, a helpful agent reply needs one. Proposal: require a policy pack for this mode, or mark
   the answer as "generic procedure — confirm" in the UI instead of in the words.
5. **A conflict inside the material** is found by the list step and surfaced about half the time. Proposal: carry
   the conflict out of the pass as its own chip next to the answer.
6. **Measurement.** Per-mode differences under about ±0.5 on 30–40 items are not results: on 2026-10-02 four
   changes each read +0.15 to +0.42 with fewer hard fails, and none could be told from zero. A change of that size
   needs about four times the items per mode, or several samples per item, to be decided either way. The judge is
   rationed (two batches a day, one shared pool) and was unavailable from 2026-10-01 12:26 UTC to 2026-10-02
   11:02 UTC. Retrieval was lexical in every run (no embedder weights in the worktrees), on both sides of every
   comparison.

## 10. Recommended next step

1. Decide the swap behaviour (item 3) and whether +0.55 on holdout against the start (+0.45 against fix6) is worth
   it; then review and land `fix/aq-astra-i5` (`e000db4a`). Kill switch: `NATIVELY_CLAIM_VERIFIER=0`.
2. Reasoning before the answer: decided against by Evin (section 0). Nothing to do; the branch stays unmerged.
3. Build the personal answer bank (item 1) — the only change on the list that moves Looking for work toward 9.
4. Make code verification gate the coding answer (item 2).
5. Before another round of small changes: a larger dev set per mode, or several samples per item, so that a gain of
   +0.3 can be decided (item 6). Without it the loop cannot tell such a change from none.

## 11. Completion report (project format)

### Change summary
* Files changed (app, branch `fix/aq-astra-i5`, since fix6): `electron/llm/claimVerifier.ts`,
  `electron/IntelligenceEngine.ts`, `electron/ipcHandlers.ts`,
  `electron/llm/__tests__/ClaimVerifier2026_09_30.test.mjs`. Harness (branch `fix/aq-astra`):
  `benchmarks/natively-answer-quality/**`.
* Behavior changed: the post-stream claim verifier lists unsupported statements before rewriting, covers Team Meet,
  Recruiting, every spoken General turn and every Seminar turn, leaves decisions / ownership / small commitments
  alone, never ships an edit in another language or one that names its own sources, and in Seminar keeps "we did
  not measure that".
* Shared modules affected: the what-to-answer path (IntelligenceEngine) and the typed chat path (ipcHandlers), both
  through `claimVerifier.ts`. Platform-specific modules affected: none.

### Cross-platform analysis
* Expected macOS behavior and expected Windows behavior are the same: the change is prompt text, regular expressions
  and string handling in TypeScript. No `process.platform` branch, no path, shell, child process, window, audio,
  capture, storage or packaging change.
* Existing platform implementations reviewed: none are touched; the two call sites are shared code.
* Affected flows: live "what to answer" and typed chat in the seven verified modes. Impact radius: the two call
  sites and the renderer's existing replace-after-stream handler (unchanged).
* Potential regressions: the text swap after streaming and +0.5–0.7 s to the settled answer; deflection on
  questions with no stored answer (section 9).

### Validation
* Unit tests: `npm run test:llm` on `f0c3a263` — 5,672 tests, 5,644 pass, 0 fail, 28 skipped. The suite ran on
  macOS. The change has no platform branch, so there is no macOS or Windows branch test to claim.
* `Tested physically on macOS`: the benchmark drives the real app (`npm run dev:agent`, development build) over CDP;
  renderer and answer pipeline only.
* `Reviewed but not executed on Windows`. `Requires physical Windows verification` for the app as a whole; nothing
  in this change is platform-sensitive.
* Not validated: a packaged build; the swap as a user sees it in the overlay (measured from the pipeline, not
  watched).

### Commands executed
`npm run test:llm` · `node tools/supervise.mjs --root <aq-fix2> --runs dev:…,holdout:…,supp-behavior:… --fresh-userdata`
· `node astra/arm.mjs 1100 …` (calibrate, judge) · `node astra/paired.mjs …` · `node tools/verifier-replay.mjs …` ·
`node tools/oververify.mjs …` · `node tools/limits-lost.mjs …` · `node tools/compose-run.mjs …` ·
`node astra/final-report.mjs --suffix -c2 …` · `node tools/iterations-qa.mjs`.

### Remaining risks
Windows not executed; packaged build not validated; holdout confirms the bundle, not each part; the final
regression set (1,038 items) was read objectively and is not judged; the unit-test line above is fix12's
(`f0c3a263`) — fix13's own run (`e000db4a`) is in `docs/ITERATIONS-ASTRA.md` under I26, with one failing test that
is described there. Nothing from the 2026-10-02 round is in the kept build.
