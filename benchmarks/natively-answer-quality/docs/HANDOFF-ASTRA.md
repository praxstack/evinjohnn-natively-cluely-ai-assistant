# Handoff — Natively 9-mode answer quality and speed (written 2026-10-03 06:20 UTC; landing added 2026-10-03)

Read this first in a new session. It says where things stand, what Evin has decided, where every file is, and how
to run each tool. The long records it points to:

| File (all under `benchmarks/natively-answer-quality/` in the harness worktree) | What it is |
|---|---|
| `docs/REPORT-ASTRA.md` | The report: outcome, scores per mode, hard fails, validators, latency, verifier rates, 20 worst answers, weaknesses, next steps. Section 0 is the latest status. |
| `docs/ITERATIONS-ASTRA.md` | The log, in order: every change tried, its evidence, each rule written before the data, each verdict. 2,100 lines; the last 600 are 2026-10-02/03. |
| `docs/ITERATIONS-QA.md` | Every DEV question with the app's answer in each of 20 runs, the judge's score where judged, and what each iteration changed. Regenerate with `node tools/iterations-qa.mjs`. Dev only: the blind sets are never listed. |
| `docs/BLOCKERS-ASTRA.md` | The architectural items, each with measurements, a proposal, benefit and risk. |

## 1. Where things stand

* **Kept build: fix13 = app commit `e000db4a`. LANDED on local main on 2026-10-03** (Evin: "commit and push
  everything to local main"), not pushed to origin: merge `98caa240` (the kept build), merge `d8d32253` (this
  harness), then `218febf5` and `0ff3f2e5` (section 4 says what those two are). **The scores below were measured
  on `e000db4a`. The merged tree has not been measured**: main had moved 155 commits, the diagram feature among them.
* **Scores, start → kept build, every answer judged on both sides (gpt-6-astra, charter v2):**
  dev 7.76 → 8.54 (+0.78 ±0.22), hard fails 89 → 37 of 360; holdout 7.92 → 8.47 (+0.55 ±0.25), 61 → 31 of 270.
* **The 9.5-per-mode target is not reachable this way.** Answers with no flagged failure average 9.28 (dev) and
  9.26 (holdout). No mode is at 9.5.
* **Every prompt-level candidate of the last round failed its pre-written rule.** Nothing new was built.
* **Evin's decisions (do not reopen without being asked):**
  1. Judge is gpt-6-astra only. A Fable-judge trial was withdrawn; its files (`abs-*-f1`, `*.judged-fable.jsonl`)
     are a record, never results.
  2. Generator stays on the DIRECT DeepSeek key (2026-10-02).
  3. No reasoning ("thinking") in the generator: "the point of natively is to answer fast" (2026-10-02).
  4. The awaited local rerank on heard turns stays: "keep as today" (2026-10-03).
  5. The discarded second reference lookup stays too: "Leave everything as it is" (2026-10-03).
* **Nothing is running.** No app, no judge chain armed, no scheduled wake. Free disk 6.8 GB at 06:10 UTC.

## 2. Rules the next session must keep

* **Keys.** Never print, log, commit or copy a key value, not even a prefix. Load by parsing the env file; never
  pass a key on a command line. Variable NAMES are fine.
* **Judge.** gpt-6-astra only. If it is not listed or is out of quota: stop and report, never substitute. The
  calibration gate (23 of 25) runs before any batch. A judgment from a key that was not calibrated in that batch is
  not pooled.
* **Holdout and the final set are blind.** Aggregates only; never print a holdout or final row or id. (Exception
  already made and logged: the final set's 116 Call Center rows were judged in aggregate for I29.)
* **Rules before data.** Write the keep/revert rule in `docs/ITERATIONS-ASTRA.md` and commit it before the rows
  are judged. Apply it as written. Objective validators outrank the judge.
* **Laptop.** One app at a time, never two. Before an app run: `pgrep -f scripts/dev-agent.mjs` must be empty and
  free disk at least 4 GB. After it: stop the app through its launcher (SIGTERM to the `dev-agent.mjs` process whose
  cwd is the app worktree), delete that worktree's `dist-electron` and `.agent/userdata`, remove any copied model
  weights. Other sessions' build output is theirs: list it for Evin, do not delete it. No large downloads.
* **Nothing lands on main without Evin.** Speed changes that alter behaviour go to Evin first (standing constraint
  from the performance audit: no behaviour changes, one fix at a time).
* **Project rules** (`CLAUDE.md`): macOS + Windows contract, completion-report format with the exact validation
  categories, graph tools before grep, `ctx7` for library docs. Commit trailer:
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## 3. Models and keys

| Role | Model | Route | Key (variable NAME only) | Where the key is |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Judge | `gpt-6-astra` | AgentRouter, `https://agentrouter.org/v1/chat/completions`, header `originator: codex_cli_rs` (approved by Evin) | `AGENTROUTER_API_KEY`, `AGENTROUTER_API_KEY_1` (the client fails over between them) | `/Users/evin/natively-cluely-ai-assistant/.env` (main repo root) |
| Generator (the app's answers, and replays) | `deepseek-flash`, temperature 0.2, `thinking: disabled` | DeepSeek's own API, `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions` | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | same file |
| Claim verifier (the app's post-answer pass) | `deepseek-flash` | same | same | same |
| Reasoning timing study only | `deepseek-v4-flash` | AgentRouter `/v1/messages` (Anthropic format, streaming) | `AGENTROUTER_API_KEY_1` | same file |

* Judge charter: v2, id `c725615a54f6` (`astra/CHARTER.md`). Result sets: `astra/out/abs-dev-c2`,
  `abs-holdout-c2`, `abs-sb-c2`; replay judgments `results/replay/<name>.judged.jsonl`. Judge cache: `astra/cache/`.
* The judge is rationed: batches open at 02:00 and 11:00 UTC; `402 Budget pool quota has been exhausted` means the
  pool is spent until the next batch. A judgment costs about 3 units of the AgentRouter balance.
* On AgentRouter's DeepSeek route only `output_config: {effort: "low"}` shortens reasoning; `reasoning_effort` is
  ignored there.

## 4. Where the code is

| Worktree | Path | Branch / commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Harness | `/Users/evin/natively-cluely-ai-assistant/.claude/worktrees/aq-fix` | `fix/aq-astra`, fast-forwarded to main after the landing | `benchmarks/natively-answer-quality/` is gitignored: new files need `git add -f`. The raw run output, judge cache and app logs exist ONLY in this worktree (ignored, about 490 MB): do not remove it |
| App | `/Users/evin/natively-cluely-ai-assistant/.claude/worktrees/aq-fix2` | checked out on `fix/aq-astra-i5` (`e000db4a`, the build that was measured), clean, no build output | `npm run dev:agent` rebuilds `dist-electron` (1.3 GB) from the working tree |
| Main checkout | `/Users/evin/natively-cluely-ai-assistant` | `main`, which now contains the landing, with OTHER sessions' uncommitted changes | read-only for this work |

App branches:
* `fix/aq-astra-i5` = `e000db4a` — **the kept build** (fix13). Merged into main on 2026-10-03.
* `fix/aq-astra-i6` = `c399f399` — Looking-for-work fallback rule + Call Center and Sales no-document notices. Not
  kept (rules failed).
* `fix/aq-astra-i7` = `3b0c1a4f` — reasoning on typed Technical interview / Lecture turns. Not kept (rule failed, and
  Evin rejected reasoning). Its code comment and commit message cite the withdrawn Fable judge.

`fix/aq-astra-i6` and `fix/aq-astra-i7` were NOT merged, on purpose: both are rejected candidates.

**A second judge was run on those two branches (2026-10-03, at Evin's request): Claude Opus 5.5** through the
headless Claude Code CLI (`AQ_JUDGE=opus`), on the same stored answers astra judged, rule written first. None of
the four changes passes under it either: reasoning +0.26 (±0.23), Looking for work +0.20 (±0.35), Call Center
+0.08 (±0.20), Sales −0.01 (±0.08). `node astra/second-judge.mjs` prints both judges side by side; the entry is at
the end of `docs/ITERATIONS-ASTRA.md`. gpt-6-astra stays the judge of record; the Opus series
(`results/replay/*.judged-opus.jsonl`) is never pooled with it. Trap: `advisorModel` in the user's Claude Code
settings turns a headless judgment into three model turns; the client clears it per process.

**What the landing changed beyond the two merges** (main was at `5213d817`):
* Two conflicts, each "both sides added at the same place", both kept. `AnswerPlanner`: the recruiting heard-turn
  demotion runs before main's design follow-up and visual-turn routing, so the diagram resolver still decides a turn
  with a design on the table. `IntelligenceEngine`: main's diagram repair helpers and the claim verifier pass are
  separate methods.
* `218febf5`: a turn that carries a visual contract (a drawing, a chart, a table) is not put through the claim
  verifier, on the hotkey and the typed pass. Main's diagram wiring test requires one provider call on such a turn
  and commits the answer as written; with the verifier running it was 149 of 158. This is new production
  behaviour: neither branch had it and the judge never scored it. Reverting it brings back those eight failures.
  Estimated offline (the resolver and the planner called directly on each dev question, no design on the table;
  not observed in the app): the resolver claims 3 of 360 dev questions (DJOB-011, DTECH-011, DTECH-012), one of
  them in a verified gate. One assertion in the diagram feature's own test changed
  (`tests/realtime-prompt/e2e-visual-catalog.cjs`, V19, an ordinary Team Meet turn with the design withheld): it
  required exactly one provider call; it now requires one answer call and that no call, the verification
  included, carries the design.
* `0ff3f2e5`: the answer-relevance and scaffold-contamination suites switch the verifier off. They hand the
  provider a fixed queue of replies, and the verification call took the next one. These 4 failures were on
  `e000db4a` itself; that suite (`npm test`) had not been run on it.
* Tests on the landed tree: type-checks (electron, premium, renderer) clean; `test:intelligence` 2,848 pass / 0
  fail; `test:llm` 5,940 / 0; `test:diagram` 1,105 + 226 / 0 and the wiring runs 78/78, 78/78, 158/158, 158/158;
  harness 27 / 0; `npm test` 13,737 pass / 5 fail. Those five, run as single files on main (`5213d817`) in the
  same checkout, fail the same way (4 need the model weights that are missing from every checkout, 1 is
  `ActivationPolicyOrdering`); a full `npm test` was not run on main. `AdversarialNewInstall` E1 failed in the
  single-file runs (on main too) and passed in the full run: flaky, and not from this work.
* NOT run: `npm run build` (tsc + vite), any app launch, the renderer suites (`test:lib`, `test:components`;
  nothing under `src/` changed), the Electron render checks of `test:diagram`, anything on Windows.
* A full build output is 1.6 GB, 1.1 GB of it source maps; with under 2 GB free the suites were run against a
  build without maps (the build script run unchanged with `sourcemap: false`, from the scratchpad).

## 5. How each mode stands (kept build)

Judged means, start → kept build, paired, with hard fails; and the mean of answers with no flagged failure ("clean"),
which is the ceiling of fixing failures.

| Mode | Dev: start → kept | gain (95 %) | hard fails | Holdout: start → kept | gain (95 %) | hard fails | Clean mean dev / holdout |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| General | 7.88 → 8.59 | +0.71 (±0.74) | 11 → 4 | 8.46 → 8.97 | +0.51 (±0.54) | 5 → 1 | 9.24 / 9.33 |
| Sales | 6.89 → 8.44 | +1.55 (±0.70) | 17 → 3 | 7.38 → 8.49 | +1.11 (±0.81) | 9 → 3 | 9.00 / 9.10 |
| Recruiting | 8.34 → 9.01 | +0.68 (±0.41) | 3 → 1 | 7.95 → 8.86 | +0.91 (±0.68) | 4 → 2 | 9.41 / 9.27 |
| Team Meet | 8.38 → 9.16 | +0.78 (±0.49) | 6 → 1 | 8.79 → 8.62 | −0.18 (±0.61) | 4 → 4 | 9.39 / 9.44 |
| Looking for work | 6.81 → 7.92 | +1.11 (±0.61) | 19 → 7 | 6.53 → 7.74 | +1.21 (±0.80) | 16 → 7 | 9.25 / 9.19 |
| Lecture | 8.81 → 8.89 | +0.08 (±0.50) | 3 → 4 | 8.87 → 8.80 | −0.07 (±0.59) | 2 → 3 | 9.53 / 9.49 |
| Technical interview | 7.50 → 8.21 | +0.71 (±0.87) | 9 → 9 | 7.86 → 8.46 | +0.60 (±0.95) | 7 → 3 | 9.55 / 9.26 |
| Seminar | 8.66 → 9.02 | +0.35 (±0.50) | 4 → 1 | 8.16 → 8.36 | +0.19 (±0.63) | 4 → 3 | 9.42 / 9.30 |
| Call Center | 6.56 → 7.63 | +1.06 (±0.79) | 17 → 7 | 7.24 → 7.93 | +0.69 (±0.89) | 10 → 5 | 8.54 / 8.94 |
| **All** | 7.76 → 8.54 | +0.78 (±0.22) | 89 → 37 | 7.92 → 8.47 | +0.55 (±0.25) | 61 → 31 | 9.28 / 9.26 |

What holds each mode back (dev hard-fail flags, kept build):
* **Looking for work** (7): invented personal claims and stories, questions only the user can answer. Needs stored
  personal answers, not a rule.
* **Call Center** (7): invented policy when no policy document exists; clean answers are also the lowest (8.54).
* **Technical interview** (9) and **Lecture** (4): the generator's own reasoning, arithmetic and complexity errors.
* **General** (4), **Sales** (3): arithmetic / unsupported company claims / a conflict in the material ignored.
* **Recruiting, Team Meet, Seminar** (1 each): an occasional invented personal or research claim.

Other measured facts about the kept build: first word unchanged against the start (about 0.87 s at the median in
the app); the settled answer comes 0.5–0.7 s later because of the claim pass, which replaces the shown text on
24–31 % of turns; on the answers it edits the pass lifts dev 6.58 → 7.72 and holdout 5.87 → 7.55 and clears most
hard fails.

## 6. The iterations

46 changes were tried; 26 are in the kept build, 20 were rejected, taken back or not built. Each one, with its
evidence, is in `docs/ITERATIONS-ASTRA.md` and summarised in section 3 of `docs/ITERATIONS-QA.md`.

**In the kept build (26):** I1 small corpus read whole · I2 hidden arithmetic scratch block · I3 the user's own
life is remembered, not checked · I4 the recruiting hotkey is the interviewer's spoken words · I5 own-life rule only
in the job modes · I6 a heard question about the user's own life is theirs to answer · I7 no product material → no
product facts · I8 claim verifier · I8b no-document product clause · I8c highlights kept, formatting-only edit is
no edit · I9 Recruiting heard turns never plan as coding · I10 Call Center states the rule, then verifies · I11
"Today" line · I13 Team Meet wording (superseded by I15) · I14 document freshness status · I15 spoken replies do
not open by reporting their notes · I16 no question handed back when something answers · I18 the verifier lists,
then rewrites; Team Meet and Recruiting verified · language rail · I21 every spoken General turn verified · I22
every Seminar turn verified · tidy edits · claim kinds · source-word rail · I25 Seminar study scope · I26 a typed
"shorter" / "simpler" / "another one" revises the previous reply.

**Rejected, taken back or not built (20):** conflict wording · past-event notice · "use the specifics" · I13
wording in the app · I17 removing the Today line · scratch-v2 · I19 technical second look · I20 missing-facts line ·
I23 "what to say instead" · I24 early stop · a larger generator · the general honest-limit exemption · "an older
version is not a conflict" · "keep every can't" in Call Center · gate-v2 · a Lecture voice rewrite · I28 reasoning
on typed Technical interview / Lecture turns · the Looking-for-work fallback rule · the Call Center "no policy on
file" notice (twice: the dev pair, then I29) · the Sales reply-shape notice.

## 7. What this session did (2026-10-02 → 10-03), in order

1. **Two AgentRouter keys.** `astra/client.mjs` fails over between them; `astra/probe.mjs` probes both;
   `astra/client-keys.test.mjs` (offline) covers it.
2. **Generator route.** DeepSeek through AgentRouter measured at about one judgment's cost per answer; Evin chose to
   keep the direct key.
3. **fix16 app run** (Call Center + Sales notices): clean, notice on exactly the heard no-document turns.
4. **Disk guard.** Free disk fell to 0.8 GB and later 0.29 GB during another session's build. `astra/store.mjs`
   (tolerant `.jsonl` reads, atomic cache writes); the client holds judge calls under 300 MB free
   (`AQ_DISK_FLOOR_MB`, up to 20 minutes), `queue3.mjs` stops on a full disk.
5. **The 11:00 UTC batch of 10-02.** Calibration 25 of 25. Four dev replay pairs judged, none met its rule:
   reasoning typed +0.18 (±0.25); Looking for work +0.15 (±0.33); Call Center +0.42 (±0.48); Sales +0.31 (±0.36).
   fix13 against fix12 on its re-run rows: +1.13 dev, +1.07 holdout (kept).
6. **Starting column judged in full** → the headline numbers in section 1. Report sections 0, 1, 3–7, 9, 10
   rebuilt (`astra/final-report.mjs`, `astra/paired.mjs`).
7. **Claim pass measured** on its edited rows (draft against shown), dev and holdout.
8. **Candidates' app rows judged** (reported only): they agree with the verdicts; the Sales notice reads negative in
   the app; the same code sampled twice differs by ±0.5 on 40 rows.
9. **I29.** The Call Center notice tested once more on the final set's 116 Call Center rows, split in halves, three
   samples per row, rule written first: decision half +0.67 (±0.42) pass, confirmation half +0.18 (±0.25) fail.
   Not promoted.
10. **Reasoning's time cost**, 431 prompts through AgentRouter DeepSeek: first answer token 1.17 s off, 2.49 s low
    effort, 3.69 s default; hard questions 1.24 / 3.12 / 4.46 s. Evin: not built.
11. **Speed.** On heard turns the app waits before it sends the request (about 0.2 s at the median, 0.3 s with a
    profile). Traced with the app's own stage traces to the bundled cross-encoder rerank (about 250 ms, one core,
    17 ms per passage on this M4, no GPU). With it off: heard first word 1.08 → 0.81 s, retrieved passages identical
    on 89 of 93 rows, app memory 1,110 → 936 MB. Evin: keep as today.
12. **Rig finding.** The default embedder's weights (`Xenova/multilingual-e5-small/onnx/model_quantized.onnx`) are
    missing in every checkout, so every benchmark run had failed query embeds and seeded profile entries. With the
    embedder working the judged score did not rise (120 dev rows: 8.38 → 8.24, −0.15 ±0.25), so the report's
    numbers stand.
13. **A second, discarded reference lookup** on V3 heard turns (`WhatToAnswerLLM.ts` builds the legacy packet, awaits
    the same rerank, about 190 ms, and throws it away; the heard path declares data scopes from it rather than from
    V3's `packedDataScopes`). Evin: leave everything as it is. Not changed.
14. **Observed, not investigated:** when DeepSeek stalls, a heard turn waits 12–16 s and shows "The model did not
    produce an answer in time, so I won't guess from your profile." (6 of 120 turns in one bad ten minutes).

## 8. The benchmark

| Set | Items | Role | File |
|---|---:|---|---|
| dev | 360 (40 per mode) | development; rows may be read | `dataset/dev.json` |
| holdout | 270 (30 per mode) | blind confirmation; aggregates only | `dataset/holdout.json` |
| supp-behavior | 72 | behaviour validators | `dataset/supp-behavior.json` |
| supp-quant | 32 | arithmetic validators | `dataset/supp-quant.json` |
| final | 1,038 (about 116 per mode) | regression read, objective only; its Call Center rows were judged in aggregate for I29 (`dataset/final-split-call-center.json`) | `dataset/final.json` |

* **Questions:** in the dataset files above (`items[].question`, with mode, surface `hotkey` = heard / `typed`,
  context and oracles).
* **Answers of every run:** `results/<run>/natively_benchmark_full.jsonl` (`raw_answer` = streamed draft,
  `rendered_answer` = shown after the claim pass; timings `ttft_ms`, `total_latency_ms`, `request_dispatch_ms`);
  the prompt sent: `natively_benchmark_wire.jsonl` + `systems.json`.
* **Runs:** dev `aq2-dev-cur` (start), `aq2-dev-fix1` … `fix16`; composites of the kept build `aq2-dev-fix13c`,
  `aq2-holdout-fix13c`; holdout start `aq-holdout-fix2`; final `aq-final-base`, `aq2-final-fix6`, `aq2-final-fix13`;
  speed runs `aq2-dev-emb1…4`, `aq2-dev-rron1`, `aq2-dev-rroff1` (not judged); replays in `results/replay/`.
* **Side by side:** `docs/ITERATIONS-QA.md` (dev questions × 20 runs).
* **Measurement limit:** a difference under about ±0.5 on 30–40 items is not a result. Deciding a +0.3 change needs
  about four times the items per mode or several samples per item (I29 did that for one mode).

```

An app run (one at a time):
```
NATIVELY_ENV_FILE=/Users/evin/natively-cluely-ai-assistant/.env CODEX_HOME=<an empty dir> \
  [MEASURE_LATENCY=true] [NATIVELY_H4_STAGE_TRACE=1] SUPERVISE_LOG_DIR=<dir> \
  node tools/supervise.mjs --root <app worktree> --runs dev:<run-id>:<mode+mode> --fresh-userdata
```
Traps, each of which cost time once:
* `NATIVELY_ENV_FILE` must be set or `run.mjs` exits at once.
* `CODEX_HOME` must point at an empty directory: the app's AI Providers pane switches Codex on by itself when it
  finds a `codex login`, and profile extraction then goes through an LLM instead of the fixed path.
* In zsh, `$run:looking…` is a modifier — write `${run}:…`. zsh does not split unquoted variables. `pgrep -f X`
  also matches your own waiting shell if its command line contains X.
* For production-like retrieval copy the model weights in, and remove them afterwards: `rsync -a --ignore-existing`
  from the main checkout's `resources/models/`, plus the embedder from
  `~/Library/Application Support/natively/embedding-experiments/multilingual-e5-small/Xenova/multilingual-e5-small/onnx/model_quantized.onnx`.
* The app's own traces: `MEASURE_LATENCY=true` (`PI LATENCY TRACE`, `[LATENCY]` stages; "stage 3 truncation"
  actually contains the legacy reference retrieval), `NATIVELY_H4_STAGE_TRACE=1` (hybrid retriever stages), and the
  `[V3] {…}` line per turn (`retrievalMs`, sources, candidates).
* `NATIVELY_RAG_LOCAL_RERANK=0` switches the bundled rerank off (measurement only; Evin kept it on).
* A whole-run app comparison has about ±0.5 of re-run noise; carry unchanged rows (replay) or use several samples.
* Check the run for provider stalls before reading it (`finish_reason` null, first word over 5 s).

## 10. What is left, and whose it is

For Evin (decisions, in the report's section 10):
1. DONE 2026-10-03: `fix/aq-astra-i5` is on local main. Its known cost is unchanged: 0.5–0.7 s more to the settled
   answer and the shown text swapped on 24–31 % of turns, for +0.55 on holdout. Kill switch:
   `NATIVELY_CLAIM_VERIFIER=0`. Still open: a dev run on the merged main (not measured), and the push to origin.
2. The personal answer bank (the only item that moves Looking for work toward 9).
3. Code verification gating the coding answer.
4. A larger dev set per mode, or samples per item, before any further round of small changes.

Not decided, noted only: the 12–16 s wait when the provider stalls.

Not verified: Windows (never executed), a packaged build, the text swap as a user sees it in the overlay.
